## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. I learned how to use a background image together with a background color to make a nice looking style.

```css
body {
    background-image: url("./images/pattern-background-mobile.svg");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-color: hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
}
```    

2. I am always learning something new about flexbox each time I use it. e.g. learned how to center a box using flexbox. The box being the order summary in this case.

```css
.body {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
} 
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

Some things that I want to focus on learning:

1. learn more about typography and making content pleasant to read. 
2. improve my layout skills with using flexbox and grid. 
3. I want to improve my use of units and learn about best practices.
